# BracuConnect
### I am still working on this project.
<br>
<br>
Bracu Connect is Database Software which I am making using Java , JavaFx and Apache Derby.
And I used "NetBeans IDE 8.2" and "SceneBuilder".
<br>


#### N.B. All the .java and .fxml files are inside "BracuConnect/JavaFXBracuConnect/src/javafxbracuconnect/ui/AdminSignup/".   "SignUp.fxml" and "SignUpController.java" are for Admin Signup. Don't get confused by the names.
