 <b> ⚫ All the passwords are hashed so no one can view the actual password from the database. </b> <br>
 <b> ⚫ Less than 4 characters password is not accepted. </b> <br>
 <b> ⚫ Previously used password (Recent one) cannot be used for security reasons. </b> <br>
 <b> ⚫ 40 seats are assigned for each section so each time any course is advised to a student then seat will decrease by 1. </b> <br>
  <b>⚫ Seat is increased by 1 when advising is updated (drop a course). </b> <br>
  <b>⚫ One cannot be enrolled if all 40 seats are assigned. </b> <br>

### N.B. All the .java and .fxml files are inside "BracuConnect/src/javafxbracuconnect/ui/AdminSignup/". Don't get confused by the name.
